# Development Structure and Implementation Plan

## Development Philosophy
- Implement features incrementally with continuous testing
- Each feature must be tested before moving to the next
- Use automated testing where possible
- Maintain flexibility for adjustments while keeping structure
- Document all major decisions and changes

3. Keep code modular and maintainable
4. Follow PEP 8 style guide
5. Use type hints consistently
6. Write comprehensive docstrings
7. Maintain backward compatibility
8. Keep security in mind at all times
